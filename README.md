Although still in early development, Abigail aims to provide a fast, lightweight and customizable cross-platform IDE. Written in C++ for speed and portability Abigail focuses largely on providing very good support for large projects and to provide fast, comfortable and efficient text editing and other amenities to the developer so that he can use it for many different types of development.

Abigail is written in C++ using Qt4 so this repository includes the Abigail.pro file that is generated by the Qt Creator IDE.
