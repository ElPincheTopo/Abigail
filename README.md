Although still in early development, Abigail aims to provide a fast, lightweight and customizable cross-platform IDE. Written in C++ for speed and portability Abigail focuses largely on providing very good support for large projects and to provide fast, comfortable and efficient text editing and other amenities to the developer so that he can use it for many different types of development. Abigail is written in C++ using Qt4, and the project is managed in Qt Creator so this repository includes the Abigail.pro file that is generated by the Qt Creator IDE.

The objective of this project is to create a lightweight cross-platform text editor that is perfect for tasks such as taking notes, writing small scripts or bulding a program. When programming many people prefer text editors like gedit, vim or emacs than IDEs. The problem with this text editors is that they don't natively integrate tools for VCS, compiling, debugging and you end up with 10 apps running simultaneously in order to write a program. We intend to fill that gap by making Abigail an awesome text editor that integrates all the tools a developer might need.
